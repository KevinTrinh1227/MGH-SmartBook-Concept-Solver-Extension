## üìå About

The **McGraw-Hill SmartBook Solver** is a lightweight browser extension that automatically goes through your **McGraw-Hill SmartBook Concept Assignments**, continuously solving questions until completion. It identifies and highlights correct answers, tracks your progress through **session and all-time statistics**, and drastically reduces the time needed to complete concept-based assignments. This SmartBook Solver is fully offline, so no AI is used. Since SmartBook Concept Assignments are graded as completion grades, we first randomly guess and then correctly answer the question the next encounter to pass the concept. This is the best approach since these assignments are only graded on completion and not accuracy.

This web browser extension is compatible with all Chromium-based browsers, including (but not limited to):
1. Google Chrome
2. Brave
3. Microsoft Edge
4. Opera GX
5. Chromium (open-source)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

McGraw-Hill SmartBook ‚ÄúConcepts‚Äù assignments are designed as **participation-based learning activities** ‚Äî not exams. You don‚Äôt earn points for getting every question correct; instead, you ‚Äúmaster‚Äù each concept over time through practice and repetition. SmartBook Concept Assignments are only for completion grades.

This extension was built with that philosophy in mind. Rather than aiming for high accuracy through AI or answer scraping, it works through **progressive learning automation**:

- The bot **selects answers randomly** on the first attempt.
- If it gets a question **wrong**, it quietly **stores the correct answer** for that concept locally (offline).
- When that same question reappears later, the bot **answers it correctly** the next time.
- Over time, the extension builds a **local cache of mastered questions**, completing concepts more efficiently.

Because all logic runs **entirely offline**, it makes no API calls or external requests ‚Äî ensuring privacy, performance, and reliability.

If SmartBook redirects you to a reading section after too many missed attempts, the extension will **automatically navigate back to the question screen** and continue working.

**Supported Question Types:**

- Multiple Choice
- Fill in the Blank
- Drag and Drop

In short, this tool simulates the natural learning cycle of ‚Äútrial and improvement,‚Äù making SmartBook sessions smoother, faster, and more focused on completion efficiency rather than accuracy chasing.
