## üìå About & Important Info <a id="about"></a>

The **McGraw-Hill SmartBook Solver** is a lightweight browser extension that automatically goes through your **McGraw-Hill SmartBook Concept Assignments**, continuously solving questions until completion. It identifies and highlights correct answers, tracks your progress, and demonstrates how web automation can streamline repetitive study tasks. Since SmartBook Concept Assignments are participation-based learning tools, the extension initially selects answers at random and later reuses correct ones from local memory to simulate progressive mastery ‚Äî purely for educational demonstration, not for graded coursework.. This is the best approach since these assignments are only graded on completion and not accuracy.

This web browser extension is compatible with all Chromium-based browsers, including (but not limited to):
1. Google Chrome
2. Brave
3. Microsoft Edge
4. Opera GX
5. Chromium (open-source)

This project was **never published publicly** because I do **not encourage academic dishonesty**. It exists purely for **educational purposes only while also providing practice in DOM automation, browser scripting, and ethical programming**. Essentially just a cool side project I thought about making since I saw a student using something similar to this once, but couldn't find it anywhere anymore.

## üß© Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

This project began as a fun and educational experiment, inspired by a similar idea I once saw, to better understand browser extensions, web automation, and content scripting.
It was an opportunity to explore how web interfaces can be interacted with programmatically and how extensions can improve user experience through automation.

That said, this tool was created strictly for educational and research purposes only. I do not encourage, support, or condone using this extension to bypass coursework or violate any academic integrity policy.

SmartBook assignments are meant to help you learn by doing, not to test automation capabilities.
I highly encourage everyone to maintain academic integrity, complete assignments honestly, and use projects like this one purely to learn development and ethical programming practices.
